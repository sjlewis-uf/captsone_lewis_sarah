MAMC Capstone Project- PetList
This project is a customized checklist that can be made for each pet in your household. Set up your account to create pet profiles and start adding to-do items that need to be tracked on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis for each pet.  Also include basic pet information like species, breed, sex, and age.
